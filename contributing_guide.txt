   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-surv-tech.git
   cd solar-surv-tech
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow existing code style
   - Comment complex logic
   - Test thoroughly on hardware if possible

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: Brief description of changes"
   ```
   
   Use prefixes:
   - `Add:` for new features
   - `Fix:` for bug fixes
   - `Update:` for improvements
   - `Docs:` for documentation

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Describe what you changed and why
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include testing details

## Code Standards

### Arduino/C++ Code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment sensor calibration values
- Include error handling
- Optimize for low power consumption
- Follow Arduino style guide

### Web Dashboard
- Keep it lightweight (rural connectivity)
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Test on multiple browsers
- Minimize external dependencies

### Documentation
- Use clear, simple language
- Include diagrams where helpful
- Provide real-world examples
- Consider non-technical users

## Development Setup

### Required Tools
- Arduino IDE 2.0+ or PlatformIO
- Git for version control
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)

### Hardware Testing
If you have access to hardware:
- Test on actual sensors when possible
- Document any calibration needed
- Note power consumption changes
- Test in various environmental conditions

### Simulation
If no hardware available:
- Use serial monitor for debugging
- Simulate sensor values in code
- Test dashboard with mock data

## Project Priorities

1. **Reliability**: Code must work in challenging conditions
2. **Low Power**: Optimize battery life
3. **Offline-First**: Function without internet
4. **Simplicity**: Easy to deploy and maintain
5. **Scalability**: Support multiple devices

## Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and inclusive
